# Hangman

Hangman is a classic word guessing game where the player is presented with a hidden word and must guess its letters one by one. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess all the letters correctly before the game ends.

## How to Play

1. Run the `hangman.py` script.
2. You will be presented with underscores representing each letter of the word to be guessed and the number of attempts left.
3. Guess a letter by typing it and pressing Enter.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, you lose an attempt.
5. Continue guessing until you either uncover the entire word or run out of attempts.

## Rules

- You have 6 attempts to guess the word.
- Only single-letter guesses are allowed.
- Guessing a letter you've already tried does not penalize you.
- Non-alphabetical characters or guesses longer than one letter are invalid.

Enjoy playing Hangman!
